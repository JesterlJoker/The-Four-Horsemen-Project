## What is this about

- A gamemode that is planned to be a mixed type of gamemode: Freeroam with Roleplay and a Twist of Deathmatches. The server will start as a roleplay server in which it will be the base of the running script, deathmatches will follow since freeroam can be done during roleplay. Roleplay interactions is a must and Roleplay rules are to be mostly followed.

## Rules

    - No Random Deathmatching
        - Ones you are on the street killing an innocent bystander is not allowed, unless the server is on deathmatch mode(will be explained thoroughly in the future)
        - This rule will include: spawn killing, weapon testing(without permission)
        - An exclusion from this rule is: On RP yet opposing RP'er does not commit to the RP(i.e Robbery RP, Hostage RP, etc)
    - No Forcing to RP
        - Telling a person to do something that they are not capabale or allowed to do.(i.e A non-allowed person to hold a gun to do a holdup stance, forcing people to do something without a situation, situations like: holdup, or roberry)
    - No Metagaming or Impossible RP
        - Doing something or telling something to do something that is not possible in real life(i.e to Fly)
    - No cheating
        - Both admins nor players are not allowed to cheat, even using special commands to win something is also not allowed.
        - Hunted in god mode is literally illegal
    - No spamming
        - It says it all
    - No asking of Adminship
        - It says it all
    - Doing Bugs is not allowed
        - Although the server is sporting anti-bug script, any other bug not under the protection of said bug will not be allowed in the server.
    - No constant jumping
        - Although this is metagaming, this rule is always broken by players so saying it again is a must.
    - Helliblading is not illegal but not recommended
        - This rule is well thought and has a reason. The word strategy is a win game. If your strategy is good then its a victory no matter how cheap it is, it is still a win. Now during roleplay this is allowed but not recommended, if the person is lower than than helliblade itself, if the helliblade will pass through objects and damaging the person inside, three if a person is within the helliblade range but the side of the copter will be hitting an object.
    - No carpark
        - Its obvious, car parking is stupid and super illegal. It kills the word fun!
    - No random car ramming
        - Car ramming is allowed only if there is a reason. A car chase, escaping arrest, spinning a criminal's car or deathmatch mode
    - No escaping
        - It says it all
    - No suicide when being chased by cops
        - It says it all
    - There will be changes to the rules that will apply to the standard of the said gamemode

    The rules above which will be broken by everyone and anyone in the server will be having a big penalty. Of which if an admin has been caught three times will get him demoted.

    Note: Total banning or Banned Forever is only done in certain circumstances(i.e cheating, hacking, and constant bugging). Bans will be as short as 1 day and as long as 6 months, in worse case scenario 7 to one year. You may still be able to logged in into the server but you will be locked into the ban island which is also the admin island. Ban players can still talk to the admins but not on everyone else. Banned players will not be able to use commands.

    Note 2: A special ban for cheaters and hackers is implemented in which logging in will not be permitted.

    Note 3: You can get yourself unbanned on two various reasons. Showing a video of deleting the cheat you are using and searching the said cheat without a result.

    Note 4: Warnings has a three count law. Ones reaching three count you will be banned to a minimum of 1 month and a maximum of two months
